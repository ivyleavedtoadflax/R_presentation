## Before we start...

* I can't teach you much in an hour...

* This session focusses on:
  * Some high level advice you might not hear elsewhere.
  * A very simple walthrough
  * Some advice for the future and where to get help

---

## Why R?

* R is free (["free" as in "free speech", not as in "free beer"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre#.22Free_beer.22_vs_.22free_speech.22_distinction)).
* Growing popularity (part of SQL server 2016).
* Can talk to Hadoop and Spark (two very popular 'big data' technologies).
* Supported by an enormous and active community.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# CRAN 'vetted' package
install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)

# Packages on github
devtools::install_github("ivyleavedtoadflax/govstyle")
# or in DfE: download the zip
devtools::install_local("C://govstyle-master.zip")

```

## Getting started on a project

(Some important things you may have never thought about)

* Setting up
* Dependency control
* Making it clear and reproducible

---

## Setting up a project

* Use RStudio projects instead.
  * Avoids use of `setwd()` - required for advanced functionality.
  * File > New Project...

---

## Dependency control

* R is constantly under development (as are packages).
* Changes to packages __can__ break your code.
* __Avoid dependency hell__ with a little planning.

The simplest way: record system info for each project.

```{r, echo=2}
# Where are your packages stored? 
.libPaths()
```

---

## Dependency control

```{r}
# Which exact packages are used?
sessionInfo()
```

---

## Dependency control

A better system for handling dependencies (in most cases).

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# Install and load the checkpoint library

install.packages("checkpoint")
library(checkpoint)

# Set a checkpoint for the project

checkpoint("2016-05-22", use.knitr = TRUE)

# Subsequently, you can load this snapshot with:

setSnapshot("2016-05-22")

```

Some packages will need to be installed manually. Watch your disk space!

---

## Reproducibility and Clarity

**The Past is a foreign country, they do things differently there**

* Code is for People (Not Computers).

```{r, eval=FALSE}

hard_to_read <- function(x) ifelse(x == 0, NA, x)

```

* Make things readable
* `# Comment liberally`

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# Function to replace zero values with NA

better <- function(x) {
  
  ifelse(x == 0, NA, x)
  
}

```

---

## Reproducibility and Clarity

* Be explicit (at least to begin with).

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# Function to replace zero values with NA

best <- function(x) {
  
  ifelse(
    test = (x == 0), 
    yes = NA, 
    no = x)
  
}

```

---

## Reproducibility and Clarity

* Reproducible formats:
  * Combine code with narrative in one document.
  * Able to handle increasingly complex documents.
  * Output to html, word, pdf (maybe).

--- .intermezzo

## Walking through a project

* The RStudio environment
* Getting the data in
* Manipulating data
* Producing outputs

---

## The RStudio environment

<img src="assets/img/RStudio.png" style="display: block; height: 550px;">

---

## The RStudio environment

```{r}

# Assign an object to the name foo

foo <- rnorm(100)

# See which objects are in my environment

ls()

```

* Beware masking other objects.
* `filter()` exists in package **stats** (loaded by default) and **dplyr** which you must load manually.
* Use `dplyr::filter()` to explicitly call the one of interest.

---

## Getting data in

Data can come from pretty much anywhere:
* Databases.
* Flat files.
* The internet.

---

## Getting data in

### Getting data from SQL server:

[Set up data connection in windows](http://statistical-research.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/database-connect.pdf).

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# Install and load RODBC
install.packages("RODBC")
library(RODBC)

# Set up a connection to the server
conn <- odbcDriverConnect()

# Get list of tables
sqlTables(conn)
  
# Execute query

sqlQuery(conn, "SELECT top 100 * FROM TABLE")

```

---
  
## Getting data in
  
### Getting data from SQL server:  

For longer queries: better to keep the files in a separate .sql file, and load them into R as required.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

read.sql

```

---

## Getting data in
  
### Getting data from flat files:

```{r}

library(readr)

# Load data from local csv file

lalonde <- read_csv("lalonde.csv")

```

Info about this data <http://users.nber.org/~rdehejia/data/nswdata2.html>

---

## Manipulating data

First look at the data

```{r}

# Because I used readr::read_csv this is a tbl_df object
lalonde
```

---

## Manipulating data

Checking data structure

```{r}
str(lalonde)
```

---

## Manipulating data

Preparing the data

```{r}

# Change dummy variables to factors: the slow way!

lalonde[,"black"] <- factor(lalonde[,"black"])
lalonde[,"hisp"] <- factor(lalonde[,"hisp"])
lalonde[,"married"] <- factor(lalonde[,"married"])
lalonde[,"nodegr"] <- factor(lalonde[,"nodegr"])
lalonde[,"treat"] <- factor(lalonde[,"treat"])
lalonde[,"nodegr"] <- factor(lalonde[,"nodegr"])
```

---

## Manipulating data

Preparing the data

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(dplyr)

# A quicker way using the pipe (%>%)

lalonde <- lalonde %>%
  mutate_each(
    funs = funs(factor),
    black, hisp, married, nodegr, treat
    )

```

---

## Manipulating data

The pipe (%>%)

```{r}

rnorm(10, mean = 10)

# The pipe passes output from one function to another
rnorm(10, mean = 10) %>% mean %>% round(2)

# In old money, this is:
round(mean(rnorm(10, mean = 10)), 2)

```

---

## Manipulating data

The pipe (%>%)

```{r}

rnorm(10, mean = 10)

# The pipe passes output from one function to another
rnorm(10, mean = 10) %>% mean %>% round(2)

# In old money, this is:
round(mean(rnorm(10, mean = 10)), 2)

```

## Producing an output


--- .intermezzo

## The long view

* Don't reinvent the wheel
* Functional programming
* Testing your code
* Writing packages

---

## Don't reinvent the wheel

* Your problem is not unique!
* Your first port of call should be google (mine is).
* Defining your problem is a skill.

--- 

## Functional programming

__D__o not __R__epeat __Y__ourself 

---

## Testing

---

## RStudio


--- .intermezzo

## Working with objects and functions

* assignment
* data types
* the workspace
* functions and arguments

---

## Assignment 

Everything in R is an object

## Loading data and getting libraries

* loading data
* libraries

## Rstudio Projects and getting help

* Rstudio projects
* Getting help in R

### Base R console

### RStudio

## Installing and using packages

One of the strengths of R is that there are literally thousands of packages available for you to extend the core capabilities of the R statistical environment. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# This installs the wordcloud package from CRAN
install.packages('wordcloud')
```
