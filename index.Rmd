## Before we start...

* I can't teach you much in an hour...

* This session focusses on:
  * Some high level advice you might not hear elsewhere.
  * A very simple walthrough.
  * Some advice for the future and where to get help.

---

## Why R?

* R is free (["free" as in "free speech", not as in "free beer"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre#.22Free_beer.22_vs_.22free_speech.22_distinction)).
* Growing popularity (part of SQL server 2016).
* Can talk to Hadoop and Spark (two very popular 'big data' technologies).
* Supported by an enormous and active community.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# CRAN 'vetted' packages
install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)

# Packages on github
devtools::install_github("ivyleavedtoadflax/govstyle")
# or in DfE: download the zip
devtools::install_local("C://govstyle-master.zip")

```

## Getting started on a project

(Some important things you may have never thought about)

* Setting up
* Dependency control
* Making it clear and reproducible

---

## Setting up a project

* Use RStudio projects.
  * Avoids use of `setwd()` - required for advanced functionality.
  * File > New Project...

---

## Dependency control

* R is constantly under development (as are packages).
* Changes to packages __can__ break your code.
* __Avoid dependency hell__ with a little planning.

The simplest way: record system info for each project.

```{r, echo=2}
# Where are your packages stored? 
.libPaths()
```

---

## Dependency control

```{r}
# Which exact packages are used?
sessionInfo()
```

---

## Dependency control

A better system for handling dependencies (in most cases).

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# Install and load the checkpoint library

install.packages("checkpoint")
library(checkpoint)

# Set a checkpoint for the project

checkpoint("2016-05-22", use.knitr = TRUE)

# Subsequently, you can load this snapshot with:

setSnapshot("2016-05-22")

```

Some packages will need to be installed manually. Watch your disk space!

---

## Reproducibility and Clarity

**The Past is a foreign country, they do things differently there**

* Code is for People (Not Computers).

```{r, eval=FALSE}

hard_to_read <- function(x) ifelse(x == 0, NA, x)

```

* Make things readable.
* `# Comment liberally`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# Function to replace zero values with NA

better <- function(x) {
  
  ifelse(x == 0, NA, x)
  
}

```

---

## Reproducibility and Clarity

* Be explicit (at least to begin with).

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# Function to replace zero values with NA

best <- function(x) {
  
  ifelse(
    test = (x == 0), 
    yes = NA, 
    no = x)
  
}

```

Note that some of the code in this presentation is not as clear as this so that it fits on a single slide!

---

## Reproducibility and Clarity

* Reproducible formats:
  * Combine code with narrative in one document.
  * Able to handle increasingly complex documents.
  * Output to html, word, pdf (maybe).

## Walking through a project

* The RStudio environment
* Getting the data in
* Manipulating data
* Producing outputs

---

## The RStudio environment

<img src="assets/img/RStudio.png" style="display: block; height: 550px;">

---

## The RStudio environment

```{r}

# Assign an object to the name foo

foo <- rnorm(100)

# See which objects are in my environment

ls()

```

* Beware masking other objects.
* `filter()` exists in package **stats** (loaded by default) and **dplyr** which you must load manually.
* Use `dplyr::filter()` to explicitly call the one of interest.

---

## Getting data in

Data can come from pretty much anywhere:
* Databases.
* Flat files.
* The internet.

---

## Getting data in

### Getting data from SQL server:

[Set up data connection in windows](http://statistical-research.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/database-connect.pdf).

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# Install and load RODBC
install.packages("RODBC")
library(RODBC)

# Set up a connection to the server
conn <- odbcDriverConnect(
  'driver={SQL Server};server=3DCPRI-PDB16;database=SWFC_Project;trusted_connection=true'
  )

# Get list of tables
sqlTables(conn, tableType = "TABLE") 
  
# Execute query

sqlQuery(conn, "SELECT TOP 10 * FROM TABLE;")

```

---
  
## Getting data in
  
### Getting data from SQL server:  

For longer queries: better to keep the files in a separate .sql file, and load them into R as required.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

read_sql <- function(sql_file_path) {
  # Check whether the sql file exists
  stopifnot(file.exists(sql_file_path))
  # Read the sql file
  sql <- readChar(sql_file_path, nchar = file.info(path)$size)
  # Return the query text
  return(sql)
}

# Now pass a query to RODBC::sqlQuery

sqlQuery(
  conn,
  read_sql("C:\\query.sql")
)

```

---

## Getting data in
  
### Getting data from flat files:

```{r}

library(readr)

# Load data from local csv file

lalonde <- read_csv("lalonde.csv")

```

Info about this data <http://users.nber.org/~rdehejia/data/nswdata2.html>

---

## Manipulating data

First look at the data

```{r}

# Because I used readr::read_csv this is a tbl_df object
lalonde
```

---

## Manipulating data

Preparing the data

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# Change dummy variables to factors: the slow way!

lalonde[,"black"] <- factor(lalonde[,"black"])
lalonde[,"hisp"] <- factor(lalonde[,"hisp"])
lalonde[,"married"] <- factor(lalonde[,"married"])
lalonde[,"nodegr"] <- factor(lalonde[,"nodegr"])
lalonde[,"treat"] <- factor(lalonde[,"treat"])
lalonde[,"nodegr"] <- factor(lalonde[,"nodegr"])
```

---

## Manipulating data

Preparing the data

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(dplyr)

# A quicker way using the pipe (%>%)

lalonde <- lalonde %>%
  # Use the lalonde dataset
  mutate_each(
    # Apply the following listed functions to...
    funs = funs(factor),
    # The following factors...
    black, hisp, married, nodegr, treat
    )

```

---

## Manipulating data

Preparing the data

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

levels(lalonde$black)

lalonde

```

---

## Manipulating data

The pipe (%>%) from package dplyr

```{r}

rnorm(10, mean = 10)

# The pipe passes output from one function to another
rnorm(10, mean = 10) %>% mean %>% round(2)

# In old money, this is:
round(mean(rnorm(10, mean = 10)), 2)

```

---

## Producing an output

A simple aggregation
```{r, eval=FALSE}

# SELECT AVG(re78) FROM lalonde GROUP BY educ

re78_agg <- lalonde %>%
  # Equivalent to GROUP BY in sql
  group_by(educ) %>%
  # equivalent to AVG(re78) in sql
  summarise(
    re78 = mean(re78)
  )

re78_agg

```

---

## Producing an output

A simple aggregation
```{r, echo=FALSE}

re78_agg <- lalonde %>%
  # Equivalent to GROUP BY in sql
  group_by(educ) %>%
  # equivalent to AVG(re78) in sql
  summarise(
    re78 = mean(re78)
  )

re78_agg

```

---

## Producing an output

Linear regression
```{r}

# Regression real earnings in 1978 against years of education

re78_model <- lm(re78 ~ educ, data = lalonde)

# Get coefficients

re78_model

```

---

## Producing an output

Linear regression

# What about other stats?

```{r}

attributes(re78_model)

# Can now call these 'slots' with $

re78_model$call

```

---

## Producing an output

Get a more complete summary

```{r}

summary(re78_model)

```

---

## Plotting

Simple plots

```{r simple_plot_code, eval=FALSE}

plot(
  x = re78_agg$educ,
  y = re78_agg$re78,
  xlab = "Years of education",
  ylab = "Real earnings in 1978 ($)"
)

```

---

## Plotting

Simple plots

```{r simple_plot_plot, echo=FALSE}

plot(
  x = re78_agg$educ,
  y = re78_agg$re78,
  xlab = "Years of education",
  ylab = "Real earnings in 1978 ($)"
)

```

---

## Plotting

Intermediate plotting with ggplot2

```{r ggplot_code, eval=FALSE}

library(ggplot2)

lalonde %>%
  # Start with lalonde dataset, pass this to a plot function
  ggplot +
  # Set aesthetic for the whole plot
  aes(
    x = educ,
    y = re78
  ) +
  # Add a layer to the plot
  geom_jitter(aes(col = nodegr)) +
  geom_smooth(method ="lm", se = FALSE) +
  xlab("Years of education") +
  ylab("Real earnings in 1978 ($)")

```

---

## Plotting

Intermediate plotting with ggplot2

```{r ggplot_plot, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}

library(ggplot2)

lalonde %>%
  # Start with lalonde dataset, pass this to a plot function
  ggplot +
  # Set aesthetic for the whole plot
  aes(
    x = educ,
    y = re78
  ) +
  # Add a layer to the plot
  geom_jitter(aes(col = nodegr)) +
  geom_smooth(method ="lm", se = FALSE) +
  xlab("Years of education") +
  ylab("Real earnings in 1978 ($)")
```

---

## Plotting

A more gov.uk friendly style

```{r ggplot_govstyle_code, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

library(ggplot2)
library(govstyle)

re78_agg %>%
  ggplot +
  aes(
    x = educ,
    y = re78
  ) +
  geom_bar(
    stat = "identity",
    fill = unname(gov_cols["turquoise"])
  ) + 
  xlab("Years of education") +
  ylab("Real earnings in 1978 ($)") +
  theme_gov() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "right",
    legend.key = element_blank()
  )

```

---

## Plotting

A more gov.uk friendly style

```{r ggplot_govstyle_plot, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}

library(ggplot2)
library(govstyle)

re78_agg %>%
  ggplot +
  aes(
    x = educ,
    y = re78
  ) +
  geom_bar(
    stat = "identity",
    fill = unname(gov_cols["turquoise"])
  ) + 
  xlab("Years of education") +
  ylab("Real earnings in 1978 ($)") +
  theme_gov() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "right",
    legend.key = element_blank()
  )
```

## The long view

* Where to get help
* Don't reinvent the wheel
* Getting more advanced

---

## Where to get help

* Start with `?lm()`.
* Google is your friend.
* Stack Overflow.
* [govdatascience.slack.com](govdatascience.slack.com)

---

## Don't reinvent the wheel

* Your problem is not unique!
* Your first port of call should be google (mine is).
* Defining your problem is a skill.

--- 

## Getting more advanced

* Functional programming is the way forward:

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# Function to replace zero values with NA

best <- function(x) {
  
  ifelse(
    test = (x == 0), 
    yes = NA, 
    no = x)
  
}

```

--- 

## Getting more advanced

* Functions can be tested

```{r, eval=FALSE}

library(testthat)

# Check that the output we get matches our expectation

expect_identical(
  # our function replaces zeros with NA - so our first argument we ask our
  # function to do this
  best(c(0,1,2,3,4,5,0)),
  # In the second argument, we give what we expect - the same vector, but with
  # zeros converted to NAs
  c(NA,1,2,3,4,5,NA)
  )

```

--- 

## Getting more advanced

* The next logical step is writing packages.
  * Documentation.
  * Portability.
  * Reproducibility.

---

## Any Questions?

* Apologies for the lightning tour!
