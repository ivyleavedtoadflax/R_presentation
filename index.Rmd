## Before we start...

* I can't teach you much in an hour...

* This session focusses on:
  * Some high level advice you might not hear elsewhere.
  * A very simple walthrough
  * Some advice for the future and where to get help

---

## Why R?

* R is free (["free" as in "free speech", not as in "free beer"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre#.22Free_beer.22_vs_.22free_speech.22_distinction)).
* Growing popularity (part of SQL server 2016).
* Can talk to Hadoop and Spark (two very popular 'big data' technologies).
* Supported by an enormous and active community.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# CRAN 'vetted' package
install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)

# Packages on github
devtools::install_github("ivyleavedtoadflax/govstyle")
# or in DfE: download the zip
devtools::install_local("C://govstyle-master.zip")

```

## Getting started on a project

(Some important things you may have never thought about)

* Setting up
* Dependency control
* Making it clear and reproducible

---

## Setting up a project

* Use RStudio projects instead.
  * Avoids use of `setwd()` - required for advanced functionality.
  * File > New Project...

---

## Dependency control

* R is constantly under development (as are packages).
* Changes to packages __can__ break your code.
* __Avoid dependency hell__ with a little planning.

The simplest way: record system info for each project.

```{r, echo=2}
# Where are your packages stored? 
.libPaths()
```

---

## Dependency control

```{r}
# Which exact packages are used?
sessionInfo()
```

---

## Dependency control

A better system for handling dependencies (in most cases).

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# Install and load the checkpoint library

install.packages("checkpoint")
library(checkpoint)

# Set a checkpoint for the project

checkpoint("2016-05-22", use.knitr = TRUE)

# Subsequently, you can load this snapshot with:

setSnapshot("2016-05-22")

```

Some packages will need to be installed manually. Watch your disk space!

---

## Reproducibility and Clarity

**The Past is a foreign country, they do things differently there**

* Code is for People (Not Computers).

```{r, eval=FALSE}

hard_to_read <- function(x) ifelse(x == 0, NA, x)

```

* Make things readable
* `# Comment liberally`

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# Function to replace zero values with NA

better <- function(x) {
  
  ifelse(x == 0, NA, x)
  
}

```

---

## Reproducibility and Clarity

* Be explicit (at least to begin with).

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# Function to replace zero values with NA

best <- function(x) {
  
  ifelse(
    test = (x == 0), 
    yes = NA, 
    no = x)
  
}

```

---

## Reproducibility and Clarity

* Reproducible formats:
  * Combine code with narrative in one document.
  * Able to handle increasingly complex documents.
  * Output to html, word, pdf (maybe).

## Walking through a project

* The RStudio environment
* Getting the data in
* Manipulating data
* Producing an output

---

## The RStudio environment

<img src="assets/img/Rstudio.png" style="display: block; height: 550px;">

---

## The RStudio environment

```{r}

# Assign an object to the name foo

foo <- rnorm(100)

# See which objects are in my environment

ls()

```

* Beware masking other functions.
* `filter()` exists in package **stats** (loaded by default) and **dplyr** which you must load manually.
* Use `dplyr::filter()` to explicitly call the one of interest.

## Installing and using packages

One of the strengths of R is that there are literally thousands of packages available for you to extend the core capabilities of the R statistical environment. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# This installs the wordcloud package from CRAN
install.packages('wordcloud')
``` 

Then to use the package, you have to load it through the library command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(wordcloud)

wordcloud(
  panama,            # this is data I mined from the common's hansard records
  scale=c(5,0.5), 
  max.words=100, 
  random.order=FALSE, 
  rot.per=0.35, 
  use.r.layout=FALSE, 
  colors=brewer.pal(8, 'Dark2')
  )
```

## Getting help

Every function has a help function with syntax and examples:

<div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; width: 100%; backgorund-color: #fff; padding: 10px 0;">
  <img src="assets/img/help.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" />
</div>

---

## Helping yourself

There is a plethora of general help books available:
<br />
<div style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">
<img src="assets/img/copy-paste.jpg" height="420">
<img src="assets/img/trying.jpg" height="420">
</div>

---

## Helping yourself

If that doesn't work:
<br />

<div style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">
<img src="assets/img/google.jpg" height="420">
</div>
